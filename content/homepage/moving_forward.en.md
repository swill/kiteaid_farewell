At this time, we are too busy with our families and careers to be able to continue the legacy of KITEAID.  We know we have developed something unique and special, however, we are not in the position to be able to continue investing the time and energy to continue operations of the business.

If you are interested in taking on KITEAID as an opportunity, we are willing to discuss passing it along.  Please [inquire](#inquires) below with your details and we can have a discussion.

Lastly, I would like to thank all of our loyal customers who have made this all possible. You have helped us build something special which will leave a lasting impression on our lives.  Thank you!
