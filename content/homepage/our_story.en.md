KITEAID was envisioned, developed and operated by two friends Stephan and Will. We met as roommates in university and shared a love of the outdoors, ultimately leading to a hobby in kitesufing. Being an engineer and a computer scientist, we both enjoyed creating things, improving on what existed and developing new ideas. 

After damaging a kite while on vacation, we set out to find the best repair kit on the market.  To our dismay, the repair options were very limited and produced unsightly repairs. In an effort to solve our own problem, we began testing different techniques on similar materials to understand what would be an effective repair. After extensive testing, we developed our first product, which you all know as the **Sail Repair Kit**. We were not intending to start a business initially, we just knew we had developed something unique and interesting, and we wanted to share it with others. As interest grew, KITEAID was born...

The initial product, the **Sail Repair Kit**, was a ripstop nylon laminated with a thermoplastic, allowing you to repair a kite and be back on the water in less than an hour. Customers asked us to develop a similar product for the leading edge and struts since it was observed that the ripstop would stretch too much when applied to struts.  We used the same technique and switched out the ripstop for Dacron to produce the **Leading Edge & Strut Repair Kit**. Things started to pick up from there. After extensive testing, we introduced a **Bladder Repair Kit**.  Customers started asking if we could develop a kit that they could use at the beach, and the **Clear Sail Tape Repair Kit** was born. There was a period where people were struggling with delaminated valves, so we crated our **Valve Donut Repair Kit**.

In our 20s, without families or children, we dedicated our evenings and weekends to advancing our offerings.  We tested new strategies and talked to our customers to understand what their experience and needs were.  As we both got married and had kids, our time to dedicate to KITEAID reduced.  We both work full time jobs outside of KITEAID, so we had less and less time to focus on it.  It started as a passion project and we have continued to keep it running for 16 years, primarily in service to the community.
