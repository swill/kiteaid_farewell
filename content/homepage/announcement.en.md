Today we are announcing that we will be closing down KITEAID. 

Over the past many years we have continued to operate KITEAID as a side business, primarily as a way to support the kitesurfing community. Our lives have evolved a lot since we started this business 16 years ago, and we do not have the focus, time and energy to continue this journey.

If you would like to reach out, please see the [inquires](#inquires) section.
